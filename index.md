# ProFACE

The new software for the probabilistic fatigue assessment of components
with defects, conceived as a tool for a quick assessment and fatigue
analysis of additively manufactured components.

*ProFACE workflow*

#### Keypoints

- It performs a **probabilistic** **fatigue assessment** of parts with
  **complex geometries** by evaluating the **effect** of volumetric
  defects and **surface** features on expected life
- post-processing of ABAQUS (R) and MSC (TM) finite element analyses
- Suitable for **Additive Manufacturing** and any **other** conventional
  manufacturing **processes**;
- Current material database:
  - AlSi10Mg
  - 17-4 PH
  - Ti6Al4V
- Developed and patented by **Politecnico di Milano**

**Typical outputs**
